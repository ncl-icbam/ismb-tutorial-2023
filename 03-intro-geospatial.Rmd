- [`spdep`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/spdep/index.html) is a collection of functions to create spatial weights matrix objects from polygon *'contiguities'*, from point patterns by distance and tessellations, for summarizing these objects, and for permitting their use in spatial data analysis like regional aggregation and tests for spatial *'autocorrelation'*.

- [`sf`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/sf/index.html) (*Simple Features for R*) is a package that offers support for simple features, a standardized way to encode spatial vector data.

- [`GWmodel`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/GWmodel/index.html) is a suit of models that fit situations when data are not described well by some global model, but where there are spatial regions where a suitably localised calibration provides a better description.

## Background
### Main geocomputatinal data structures
There are three main data structures that we need to have ready before we undertake a geocomputational approach to STx data analysis. Namely these are; (1) geometries (point and polygon), (2) neighbours lists and (3) distance matrices.

  1. Spatial geometries can be points, lines, polygons and pixels. Polygons consist of a multitude of points connected by lines and can have many forms like circle, hexagon, non-canonical polygon etc.
  
  2. Neighbour lists are special types of lists that contain information about the neighbours of each polygon. The neighbours can be defined either by adjacency or by distance.
  
  3. Distance matrices contain the distances between different points and can be either weighted or un-weighted. The weighted distances are usually objective to each point and its neighbours. Meaning that the closer or farther a neighbour is from the point of focus, the weight of their distance changes according to an applied kernel. Usually in the case of STx data, like the ones generated by the 10X Visium platform, the un-weighted distance between is two points is in pixels and we acquire it from the `spaceranger` output.
  
### The `sf` objects
Package `sf` represents simple features as native R objects. All functions and methods in `sf` that operate on spatial data are prefixed by *st_*, which refers to *spatial type*. Simple features are implemented as R native data, using simple data structures (S3 classes, lists, matrix, vector). Typical use involves reading, manipulating and writing of sets of features, with attributes and geometries.

As attributes are typically stored in `data.frame` objects (or the very similar `tbl_df`), we will also store feature geometries in a `data.frame` column. Since geometries are not single-valued, they are put in a list-column, a list of length equal to the number of records in the `data.frame`, with each list element holding the simple feature geometry of that feature.  The three classes used to represent simple features are:

* `sf`, the table (`data.frame`) with feature attributes and feature geometries, which contains
* `sfc`, the list-column with the geometries for each feature (record), which is composed of
* `sfg`, the feature geometry of an individual simple feature.

#### Simple feature geometry types

The following seven simple feature types are the most common:

| type | description                                        |
| ---- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| `POINT` | zero-dimensional geometry containing a single point |
| `LINESTRING` | sequence of points connected by straight, non-self intersecting line pieces; one-dimensional geometry |
| `POLYGON` | geometry with a positive area (two-dimensional); sequence of points form a closed, non-self intersecting ring; the first ring denotes the exterior ring, zero or more subsequent rings denote holes in this exterior ring |
| `MULTIPOINT` | set of points; a MULTIPOINT is simple if no two Points in the MULTIPOINT are equal |
| `MULTILINESTRING` | set of linestrings |
| `MULTIPOLYGON` | set of polygons |
| `GEOMETRYCOLLECTION` | set of geometries of any type except GEOMETRYCOLLECTION |

Each of the geometry types can also be a (typed) empty set, containing zero coordinates (for `POINT` the standard is not clear how to represent the empty geometry). Empty geometries can be thought of being the analogue to missing (`NA`) attributes, NULL values or empty lists.

#### sf: objects with simple features

As we usually do not work with geometries of single `simple features`, but with datasets consisting of sets of features with attributes, the two are put together in `sf` (simple feature) objects.  The following command reads a test dataset called `nc` from a file that is contained in the `sf` package:

```{r 03_sf_LoadTest}
nc <- st_read(system.file("shape/nc.shp", package = "sf"))
```

The short report printed gives the file name, the driver (ESRI Shapefile), mentions that there are 100 features (records, represented as rows) and 14 fields (attributes, represented as columns). 

This object is of class:
```{r 03_sf_TestClass}
class(nc)
```

meaning it extends (and "is" a) `data.frame`, but with a single list-column with geometries, which is held in the column with name:

```{r 03_sf_Test_sf_column}
attr(nc, "sf_column")
```

If we print the first three features, we see their attribute values and an abridged version of the geometry

```{r 03_sf_Test_print, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
print(nc[9:15], n = 3)
```

which would give the following output:

```{r Sf-overview, echo=FALSE, out.width = "100%", fig.align="center", fig.cap="Overview of the `sf` object."}
knitr::include_graphics("images/sf_xfig.png")
```

In the output we see:

* in green a simple feature: a single record, or `data.frame` row, consisting of attributes and geometry
* in blue a single simple feature geometry (an object of class `sfg`)
* in red a simple feature list-column (an object of class `sfc`, which is a column in the `data.frame`)
* that although geometries are native R objects, they are printed as [well-known text](#wkb)

It is also possible to create `data.frame` objects with geometry list-columns that are not of class `sf`, e.g. by:
```{r 03_sf_no.sf}
nc.no_sf <- as.data.frame(nc)
class(nc.no_sf)
```

However, such objects:

* no longer register which column is the geometry list-column
* no longer have a plot method, and
* lack all of the other dedicated methods for class `sf`

#### sfc: simple feature geometry list-column

The column in the `sf` data.frame that contains the geometries is a list, of class `sfc`. We can retrieve the geometry list-column in this case by using standard `data.frame` notation like `nc$geom` or `nc[[15]]`, but the more general way uses `st_geometry`:

```{r 03_sfc_Test1}
(nc_geom <- st_geometry(nc))
```

Geometries are printed in abbreviated form, but we can view a complete geometry by selecting it, e.g. the first one by:

```{r 03_sfc_Test2}
nc_geom[[1]]
```

The way this is printed is called *well-known text*, and is part of the standards. The word `MULTIPOLYGON` is followed by three parentheses, because it can consist of multiple polygons, in the form of `MULTIPOLYGON(POL1,POL2)`, where `POL1` might consist of an exterior ring and zero or more interior rings, as of `(EXT1,HOLE1,HOLE2)`. Sets of coordinates are held together with parentheses, so we get `((crds_ext)(crds_hole1)(crds_hole2))` where `crds_` is a comma-separated set of coordinates of a ring. This leads to the case above, where `MULTIPOLYGON(((crds_ext)))` refers to the exterior ring (1), without holes (2), of the first polygon (3) - hence three parentheses.

We can see there is a single polygon with no rings:

```{r 03_sfc_Test3, fig.height=3}
par(mar = c(0,0,1,0))
plot(nc[1], reset = FALSE) # reset = FALSE: we want to add to a plot with a legend
plot(nc[1,1], col = 'grey', add = TRUE)
```

Following the `MULTIPOLYGON` data structure, in R we have a list of lists of lists of matrices. For instance,
we get the first 3 coordinate pairs of the second exterior ring (first ring is always exterior) for the geometry
of feature 4 by:

```{r 03_sfc_Test4}
nc_geom[[4]][[2]][[1]][1:3,]
```

Geometry columns have their own class,

```{r 03_sfc_Test5}
class(nc_geom)
```

#### sfg: simple feature geometry

Simple feature geometry (`sfg`) objects carry the geometry for a single feature, e.g. a point, linestring or polygon.

Simple feature geometries are implemented as R native data, using the following rules

1. a single POINT is a numeric vector
2. a set of points, e.g. in a LINESTRING or ring of a POLYGON is a `matrix`, each row containing a point
3. any other set is a `list`

```{r 03_sf_Test6, echo=FALSE, eval=TRUE, message=FALSE}
p <- rbind(c(3.2,4), c(3,4.6), c(3.8,4.4), c(3.5,3.8), c(3.4,3.6), c(3.9,4.5))
(mp <- st_multipoint(p))
s1 <- rbind(c(0,3),c(0,4),c(1,5),c(2,5))
(ls <- st_linestring(s1))
s2 <- rbind(c(0.2,3), c(0.2,4), c(1,4.8), c(2,4.8))
s3 <- rbind(c(0,4.4), c(0.6,5))
(mls <- st_multilinestring(list(s1,s2,s3)))
p1 <- rbind(c(0,0), c(1,0), c(3,2), c(2,4), c(1,4), c(0,0))
p2 <- rbind(c(1,1), c(1,2), c(2,2), c(1,1))
pol <-st_polygon(list(p1,p2))
p3 <- rbind(c(3,0), c(4,0), c(4,1), c(3,1), c(3,0))
p4 <- rbind(c(3.3,0.3), c(3.8,0.3), c(3.8,0.8), c(3.3,0.8), c(3.3,0.3))[5:1,]
p5 <- rbind(c(3,3), c(4,2), c(4,3), c(3,3))
(mpol <- st_multipolygon(list(list(p1,p2), list(p3,p4), list(p5))))
(gc <- st_geometrycollection(list(mp, mpol, ls)))
```

The below figure illustrates the different types of geometries:

```{r 03_sf_Test7, echo=FALSE, eval=TRUE}
par(mar = c(0.1, 0.1, 1.3, 0.1), mfrow = c(2, 3))
plot(mp, col = 'red')
box()
title("MULTIPOINT")
plot(ls, col = 'red')
box()
title("LINESTRING")
plot(mls, col = 'red')
box()
title("MULTILINESTRING")
plot(pol, border = 'red', col = 'grey', xlim = c(0,4))
box()
title("POLYGON")
plot(mpol, border = 'red', col = 'grey')
box()
title("MULTIPOLYGON")
plot(gc, border = 'grey', col = 'grey')
box()
title("GEOMETRYCOLLECTION")
par(mfrow = c(1, 1))
```

Geometries can also be empty, as in

```{r 03_sf_Test8, collapse=TRUE}
(x <- st_geometrycollection())
length(x)
```

*The above are taken from the very well written, well-descriptive and thorough `sf` package [vignette](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/sf/vignettes/sf1.html).*

## Data structures preparation
For this practical we will be using a human steatotic kidney dataset from the [Liver Atlas](https://livercellatlas.org/index.php) [@GUILLIAMS2022379]. Specifically we will use the JBO019 sample.

### Load new dataset
First we generate the `SpatialFeaturesExperiment` object which is an extension of the `SpatialExperiment` (SPE) object that we used in the 2nd practical session. The difference is that the SFE object has incorporated the `sf` object structure and thus can accommodate the use of geocomputational tools.

```{r 03_load_sfe, warning=FALSE}
sampleDir <- "./data/spaceranger_outs/Human_Liver_Steatotic/JBO019_Results"
sampleNames <- "JBO019"
sfe <- read10xVisiumSFE(samples = sampleDir, 
                        sample_id = sampleNames, 
                        type = "sparse", 
                        data = "filtered", 
                        images = "lowres", 
                        style = "W", 
                        zero.policy = TRUE)

ground_truth <- read_table("./data/spotzonationGroup.txt")
```

```{r 03_QC_sfe}
is_mito <- grepl("(^MT-)|(^mt-)", rowData(sfe)$symbol)
sfe <- addPerLocQC(sfe, gTruth = ground_truth, assay = "counts", 2, subsets = list(mito = is_mito))
sfe <- addGeometries(sfe, samples = sampleDir, sample_id = sampleNames, res = "fullres")
sfe <- addPerGeneQC(sfe, assay = "counts", version = 92)
sfe <- get.spatialNeighGraphs(sfe, sampleNames, type = "knearneigh", style = "W", distMod = "raw", k = 6)


colData(sfe)
rowData(sfe)
colGeometries(sfe)
colGraphs(sfe)

```


################################################################################
```{r 03_load_STx_counts}
## Load counts table
inputD <- readRDS(file = "./data/hsLivSteat_JBO019_inputD.rds")
inputD[1:5, 1:3]
```

Then we load the spot metadata. The imported table has the below columns:

* **Barcode:** the spot barcode (*note that we substituted the "-" with a "." to match the column names in the inputD because it is not good practise to have "-" in column names in R*).  
* **Section:** whether the spot is on- or off- tissue (on-tissue = 1, off-tissue = 0).  
* **Spot_Y/ Spot_X:** X and Y spot location on the capture area array.  
* **Image_Y/ Image_X:** X and Y spot coordinates in the full resolution image.  
* **pixel_x/ pixel_y:** X and Y spot coordinates in the low resolution image.  
```{r 03_load_STx_spotMetaData}
## Load spot metadata
inputMD <- readRDS(file = "./data/hsLivSteat_JBO019_inputMD.rds")
head(inputMD)
```

### Create point geometries
First we want to extract the pixel coordinates from the `inputMD` data frame and then we will generate the point geometries (centroids) from all spots of the 10X Visium capture area. This helps to tessellate space better in the next step.

```{r 03_pointGeom, collapse=TRUE}
## Extract coordinates
spot_position <- inputMD %>% 
    select(c("Barcode", "pixel_x", "pixel_y", "Section"))

head(spot_position, 5)

## Convert spots to centroids
centroids <- spot_position %>% 
  st_as_sf(coords = c("pixel_x", "pixel_y"), 
           remove = FALSE)
head(centroids, 5)
```

### Tesselate space
Here we will take the steps towards tessellating space. This tessellation, brakes the area that surrounds the spots and as a result we can use it to find neighbours by adjacency later on. We need to always keep in mind that although tessellation makes the spots have common borders, the 10X Visium spots have a distance between them that is approximately 50μm.

- First, we combine the points we calculated earlier into a multipoint geometry.
- Second, we tessellate space around the points using the Voronoi tessellation.
- Third, we can cut the tessellation around the edges because tessellation extends to infinity.

```{r voronoi-tessellation}
## Combine the points into a multipoint geometry:
cntd_union <- st_union(centroids)
head(cntd_union)

## Use the union of points to generate a voronoi object
voronoi <- st_voronoi(cntd_union, bOnlyEdges = TRUE)
head(voronoi)

## Create an enveloped voronoi tessellation around the tissue
voronoi_env <- st_intersection(st_cast(voronoi), st_convex_hull(cntd_union))
head(voronoi_env)
```

```{r plot_voronoi, fig.show = 'hold', out.width="50%", fig.height=5, fig.width=4}
## Plot tessellation as is
ggplot(data = voronoi) + geom_sf() + labs(title = "Tessellation") + theme_void()
## Plot enveloped tessellation
ggplot(data = voronoi_env) + 
  geom_sf() + 
  labs(title = "Tessellation cut to capture area") + 
  theme_void()
```

### Polygonise the tessellation

Here we will extract polygons from the tessellation object only for the spots that are on-tissue. Meaning, they have a value of **1** in the `Section` column.
```{r polygonise}
## Generate the POLYGONS from the MULTILINESTRING
polygons <- st_polygonize(voronoi_env) %>% # polygonise the tessellation
    st_cast() %>% # convert GEOMETRYCOLLECTION to multiple POLYGONS
    st_sf() %>%  # convert sfc object to sf for st_join afterwards
    st_join(., 
            centroids[centroids$Section == 1,],
            join = st_contains,
            left = FALSE) %>%
    dplyr::rename(geom_pol = geometry) %>% # Join the centroids with the POLYGONS 
    mutate(Barcode_rn = Barcode) %>% # duplicate the barcode column
    column_to_rownames("Barcode_rn") %>% # move duplicate column to row names
    st_sf() # convert back to sf (mutate makes it a df)

head(polygons)
```
As you may have observed we joined the `polygons` object with the `centroids` object so that we can add the rest of the information like `Barcode`, `pixel_x`, and  `pixel_y`.

If we plot it:
```{r plot_map1, fig.height=5, fig.width=4}
## Plot on tissue polygons
ggplot(data = polygons) + geom_sf(aes(geometry = geom_pol)) + theme_void()
```

Because there are times that we will need the polygons and times that we will need their centroids we can add both geometries in the `polygons` object.
```{r 03_geoms-PolCnt, message=FALSE}
## Update the polygon object to keep the centroid geometries as well
polygons <- polygons %>% # rename polygons geom column
  left_join(as.data.frame(centroids)) %>% # left joint pols and cntds
  dplyr::rename(geom_cntd = geometry) %>% # rename centroids geom column
  st_sf(sf_column_name = "geom_pol") # set polygons geom column to be the default (one must be)

head(polygons)
```

As we can see here we have two geometry columns; one named `geom_pol` and one named `geom_cntd`. As a result we need to have one of these two as the active geometry column for the `polygons` object of class `sf`. We can see at the top of the printed output that the active geometry column is `geom_pol`. In general we can switch between geometry columns using: `st_geometry(sf_object) <- "geom_column_to_change_to"`

### Identify neighbours
#### By contiguity
We can contiguity-based neighbours for each spot using the `poly2nb` function from `spdep`. The function is using heuristics to identify polygons sharing boundary points as neighbours. It also has a `snap =` argument, to allow the shared boundary points to be a short distance from one another. Here we select `snap = 0` because the tessellation generated polygons with shared borders. Finally, the `queen =` argument is set to `TRUE`. This means that the function will look for a chess queen-style of contiguities.
```{r get_adjacent_neighbours_a, message=FALSE, collapse=TRUE}
## Get contiguity neighbours
nb_adjc <- poly2nb(pl = polygons,
                   snap = 0,
                   queen = TRUE)
length(nb_adjc)
head(nb_adjc)
```
```{r get_adjacent_neighbours_b, message=FALSE, fig.show = 'hold', out.width="50%", fig.height=4, fig.width=5}
nb_adjc_n <- card(nb_adjc)

ggplot() + 
  geom_histogram(aes(x = nb_adjc_n, y = after_stat(density)), 
                 colour = "black", 
                 fill = "grey") +
  geom_density(aes(x = nb_adjc_n),
               alpha = 0.5,
               adjust = 0.5,
               fill = "#A0CBE8",
               colour = "#4E79A7") +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = scales::pretty_breaks(n = 6)) + 
  scale_y_continuous(breaks = scales::pretty_breaks(n = 10)) +
  xlab("Number of Neighbours") +
  theme_classic()

ggplot() + 
  geom_sf(data = polygons, 
          aes(geometry = geom_pol), 
          colour = "grey30", fill = "white") +
  geom_sf(data = as(nb2lines(nb_adjc, coords = polygons$geom_cntd), "sf"), 
          colour = "black", linewidth = 0.25) +
  geom_sf(data = polygons,
          aes(geometry = geom_cntd),
          colour = "black", size = 1) +
  theme_void()
```

As you can see, the neighbours object is a `list` of length equal to the number of spots we have in the dataset. Each element of the list represents a spot and the numbers stored inside the indexes of the neighbouring spots and the spots have a different numbers of neighbours. The connectivity histogram visualises the distribution of the number of neighbours in the data.

#### By graph
Once representative points are available, the criteria for neighbourhood can be extended from just contiguity to include graph measures, distance thresholds, and 𝑘-nearest neighbours.

The most direct graph representation of neighbours is to make a Delaunay triangulation of the points, which extends outwards to the convex hull of the points. Note that graph-based representations construct the interpoint relationships based on Euclidean distance. Because it joins distant points around the convex hull, it may be worthwhile to thin the triangulation as a Sphere of Influence (SOI) graph, removing links that are relatively long. Points are SOI neighbours if circles centred on the points, of radius equal to the points’ nearest neighbour distances, intersect in two places [@Avis1985].

```{r get_graph_neighbours1a, message=FALSE, collapse=TRUE}
## Set centroids as default geometry
st_geometry(polygons) <- "geom_cntd"
## Get the neighbour names
nb_names <- polygons$Barcode

## By Delaunay triangulation
nb_tri <- tri2nb(polygons$geom_cntd, row.names = nb_names)
length(nb_tri)
head(nb_tri)
```
```{r get_graph_neighbours1b, message=FALSE, fig.show = 'hold', out.width="50%", fig.height=4, fig.width=5}
nb_tri_n <- card(nb_tri)

ggplot() + 
  geom_histogram(aes(x = nb_tri_n, y = after_stat(density)), 
                 colour = "black", 
                 fill = "grey") +
  geom_density(aes(x = nb_tri_n),
               alpha = 0.5,
               adjust = 0.5,
               fill = "#A0CBE8",
               colour = "#4E79A7") +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = scales::pretty_breaks(n = 10)) + 
  scale_y_continuous(breaks = scales::pretty_breaks(n = 10)) +

ggplot() + 
  geom_sf(data = polygons, 
          aes(geometry = geom_pol),

          aes(geometry = geom_cntd),

Delaunay triangulation neighbours and SOI neighbours are symmetric by design – if 𝑖 is a neighbour of 𝑗, then 𝑗 is a neighbour of 𝑖. The Gabriel graph is also a subgraph of the Delaunay triangulation, retaining a different set of neighbours [@Matula1980]. It does not, however, guarantee symmetry; the same applies to Relative graph neighbours [@Toussaint1980Jan].

#### By distance
An alternative method is to choose the 𝑘 nearest points as neighbours – this adapts across the study area, taking account of differences in the densities of areal entities. Naturally, in the overwhelming majority of cases, it leads to asymmetric neighbours, but will ensure that all areas have 𝑘 neighbours.
```{r get_distance_neighbours1a, collapse=TRUE}
## Set centroids as default geometry
st_geometry(polygons) <- "geom_cntd"
## Get distance-based neighbours
nb_knn <- knn2nb(knearneigh(polygons, k = 6), 
                 row.names = nb_names)
length(nb_knn)
head(nb_knn)
```

  geom_sf(data = as(nb2lines(nb_knn, coords = polygons$geom_cntd), "sf"), 
          colour = "black", linewidth = 0.25) +

As you can see, this neighbours object is also a `list` of length equal to the number of spots we have in the dataset with the same content as the one earlier. Also, in this list all spots have the same number of neighbours since we selected *k = 6* which means we have the 6 nearest by distance spots. Another interesting fact here is that spots that are not adjacent to each other now might be neighbours.

Another way to find neighbours by distance is to first generate a graph for *k = 1*. This way we can find the shortest and the longest distance needed for a spot to acquire one neighbour. Then, we can use another function called `dnearneigh` which is used to find neighbours with an interpoint distance, with arguments `d1` and `d2` setting the lower and upper distance bounds. There as a lower bound we can provide zero or the shortest distance a neighbour is found in our dataset and as an upper bound we can provide a value that is a function of the largest distance a neighbour is found in our dataset.
```{r get_distance_neighbours2a}
## Get distance-based neighbours for k = 1
nb_1nn <- knn2nb(knearneigh(polygons, k = 1), 
                 row.names = nb_names)
dsts <- unlist(nbdists(nb_1nn, polygons$geom_cntd))
summary(dsts)
max_1nn <- max(dsts)
min_1nn <- min(dsts)
```

As you can see, because the 10X Visium spots are equidistant, the majority of the distances is around 6 pixels. Additionally, the maximum distance is almost 20 times the minimum. This is due to the one spot we keep having on the left of our tissue area. As a result in our dataset we will use as upper bound a value that is a function of the minimum distance instead of the maximum.

Let's have a look at how the dataset looks with the maximum as upper boundary

```{r get_distance_neighbours2b_a}
nb_1nna <- dnearneigh(polygons$geom_cntd, d1 = 0, d2 = 1*max_1nn, row.names = nb_names)
str(nb_1nna[1:5])
nb_1nna_n <- card(nb_1nna)
```
```{r get_distance_neighbours2b_b, message=FALSE, fig.height=4, fig.width=5}
ggplot() + 
  geom_histogram(aes(x = nb_1nna_n, y = after_stat(density)), 
                 colour = "black", 
                 fill = "grey") +
  geom_density(aes(x = nb_1nna_n),
               alpha = 0.5,
               adjust = 0.5,
               fill = "#A0CBE8",
               colour = "#4E79A7") +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = scales::pretty_breaks(n = 10)) + 
  scale_y_continuous(breaks = scales::pretty_breaks(n = 10)) +
  xlab("Number of Neighbours") +
  theme_classic()
```

As you can see, the number of neighbours each spot acquires because we use the maximum distance as the upper bound is massive and as a result it will not plot correctly.

```{r get_distance_neighbours2c, fig.show = 'hold', out.width="33%", fig.height=5, fig.width=4}
nb_1nnb <- dnearneigh(polygons$geom_cntd, d1 = 0, d2 = 1*min_1nn, row.names = nb_names)
nb_1nnc <- dnearneigh(polygons$geom_cntd, d1 = 0, d2 = 1.5*min_1nn, row.names = nb_names)
nb_1nnd <- dnearneigh(polygons$geom_cntd, d1 = 0, d2 = 1.75*min_1nn, row.names = nb_names)

ps <- grep("nn[b,c,d]", names(.GlobalEnv), value = TRUE)

  q <- get(p)

      labs(title = p) +
      theme_void()) %>% print()
}

  q_n <- card(q)

  (ggplot() + 
    geom_histogram(aes(x = q_n, y = after_stat(density)), 
                   colour = "black", 
                   fill = "grey") +
    geom_density(aes(x = q_n),
                 alpha = 0.5,
                 adjust = 0.5,

Using the maximum as the upper limit is not prohibited, it is just not advised if you plan to plot the neighbour relationships on a map.

*The above for identifying neighbours are partially taken from the very well written, well-descriptive and thorough `spdep` package [vignette](https://r-spatial.github.io/spdep/articles/nb.html#distance-based-neighbours) for neighbours identification.*  

#### Adding spatial weights
The neighbour lists can be supplemented with spatial weights using the `nb2listw` and `nb2listwdist` function from `spdep` package for the chosen type and coding scheme style. There are 6 different coding scheme styles that can be used to weigh neighbour relationships:

1. **B**: is the basic binary coding (1 for neighbour, 0 for no neighbour).
2. **W**: is row standardised (sums over all links to n).
3. **C**: is globally standardised (sums over all links to n).
4. **U**: is equal to C divided by the number of neighbours (sums over all links to unity).
5. **S**: is the variance-stabilizing coding scheme (sums over all links to n).
6. **minmax**: divides the weights by the minimum of the maximum row sums and maximum column sums of the input weights; It is similar to the C and U styles.

The coding scheme style is practically the value each neighbour will get. For example, in a binary coding scheme style (**B**) if a spot is a neighbour of the spot in focus then gets the value of **1**, else gets **0**. Another example, in a row standardised coding scheme style (**W**) if the spot in focus has a total of 10 neighbours and each neighbour has a weight of 1, then the sum of all neighbour weights is 10, and each neighbour will get a normalised weight of 1/10 = 0.1. As a result, in the row standardised coding scheme, spots with many neighbours will have neighbours with lower weights and thus will not be over-emphasised.

Starting from a binary neighbours list, in which regions are either listed as neighbours or are absent (thus not in the set of neighbours for some definition), we can add a distance-based weights list. The `nb2listwdist` function supplements a neighbours list with spatial weights for the chosen types of distance modelling and coding scheme. While the offered coding schemes parallel those of the `nb2listw` function above, three distance-based types of weights are available: inverse distance weighting (IDW), double-power distance weights (DPD), and exponential distance decay (EXP). The three types of distance weight calculations are based on pairwise distances 𝑑𝑖𝑗, all of which are controlled by parameter *“alpha”* (𝛼 below):

1. **idw**: 𝑤𝑖𝑗=𝑑−𝛼𝑖𝑗,
2. **exp**: 𝑤𝑖𝑗=exp(−𝛼⋅𝑑𝑖𝑗),
3. **dpd**: 𝑤𝑖𝑗=[1−(𝑑𝑖𝑗/𝑑max)𝛼]𝛼,

the latter of which leads to 𝑤𝑖𝑗=0 for all 𝑑𝑖𝑗>𝑑max. Note that *IDW* weights show extreme behaviour close to 0 and can take on the value infinity. In such cases, the infinite values are replaced by the largest finite weight present in the weights list.

The default coding scheme for `nb2listwdist` is “raw”, which outputs the raw distance-based weights without applying any kind of normalisation. In addition, the same coding scheme styles that are also available in the `nb2listw` function can be chosen.

Below we will use only the `nb2listwdist` function which can accommodate both weight types and coding scheme styles.

```{r 03_spatial_weights_to_nb}
## Set centroids as default geometry
st_geometry(polygons) <- "geom_cntd"
## Add weights
nb_adjc_w <- nb2listwdist(nb_adjc, polygons, type = "idw", style = "W", zero.policy = TRUE)
## Have a look
nb_adjc_w$weights[1:5]
```

### Generate distance matrices
A distance matrix is a mirrored matrix that contains the distance between a spot and every other spot. This distance can be a simple Euclidean distance based on the coordinates of the spots or a weighted distance according to a bandwidth around each spot using a kernel that gives higher scores to distances between spots that are closer together compared to the ones that are farther away. These weighted distance matrices are later used to run geographically weighted (GW) models.

There are 6 different kernels that can be used to weight the distances between spots. The next two figures are from the `GWmodel`'s publication [@Gollini2015Feb] and provide a bit more description on that.

```{r GWmodel_fig1, echo=FALSE, out.width = "100%", fig.align="center", fig.cap="The math equations that define the kernels."}

```

```{r GWmodel_fig2, echo=FALSE, out.width = "100%", fig.align="center", fig.cap="Examples from using each kernel."}
knitr::include_graphics("images/gwmodel_kernel_graphs.png")
```

```{r 03 dist_matrix}
## Set centroids as default geometry
st_geometry(polygons) <- "geom_cntd"
## Get Euclidean distances between spots
dist.Mat <- gw.dist(dp.locat = st_coordinates(polygons), p = 2)
rownames(dist.Mat) <- nb_names
colnames(dist.Mat) <- nb_names
dist.Mat[1:5, 1:4]
## Set bandwidth
bw = (range(dist.Mat)[2])/2
bw
## Select a kernel
kernel = "bisquare"
## Calculate W distance matrix
w <- gw.weight(vdist = dist.Mat, 
               bw = bw,
               kernel = kernel,
               adaptive = FALSE)
rownames(w) <- nb_names
colnames(w) <- nb_names
w[1:5, 1:4]
```
